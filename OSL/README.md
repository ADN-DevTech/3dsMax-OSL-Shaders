### ADN-Experimental

Contains shaders in flux and in development that may change completely tomorrow. 
Use these with caution, and its probably safest to use them in unlinked mode, because
if you download a new version in the future, the behavior may have changed enough such
that your old scenes no longer work.

### ADN-Stable

These are shaders that are mature anough and stable enough that the intent is that
the shaders interface and behaviour won't substantially change in the future. It may
gain parameters, but defaults should be compatible with the previous version. These 
shaders are candidates to be included in the shipping set in the next version.

### ADN-User Submitted

These are shaders submitted by users. Please only upload shaders you've written yourself
or where you can be certain the license is explicitly permissive. This is a sharing site
and OSL files will be flying left and right.

Each user builds their own subdirectory under this to place their shaders. Some may later
be promoted to other folders.
