# How to submit OSL shaders to this repository

If you want to contribute to this repository, you are very welcome to do so! 

Please only upload shaders you've written yourself or that is based on code that itself
has a sufficiently permissive license. 

We require all files in this repository to be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, which is
a very permissive open-source license. You keep the copyright to your original files, but give
a license to anyone to use them for any reason, including use in a commercial product (in case we
like your shader so much we want to put it into a future 3ds Max version.)

## What you need to do:

### Add a license header to your file

If not there, add to the header of your file that it is under the Apache 2.0 license by adding 
this line or something equivalent:

	// License: Apache 2.0 License
	//   https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/3dsMax-OSL-Shaders/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

### To submit your own work to this repository

First, each person wanting to contribute to this repo must you first sign a Contributor Licence Agreement,
scan it and email to us. This is a one-time thing per person, and exists for both your and our protection.
